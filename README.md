## Artificial Intelligence Art

Artificial intelligence Art refers to any artwork created through the use of artificial intelligence. Artificial Intelligence Art (AI Art) is an artistic niche developed thanks to the latest advances in computer vision and deep learning. In particular, its development has been aided by the massive adoption by researchers and artists of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), a class of machine learning invented by researcher Ian Goodfellow and colleagues in 2014.
